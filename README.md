# Launch the Application using Docker
   
   1. Switch to the branch 'web-branch'.
         `git checkout web-branch`
   2. Launch Docker container
         `docker compose up`
   3. Access the application using above end-points at address `localhost:8080/` using Postman.
   4. Stop the containers after using the application
         `docker compose down`

# Hints to play
   
   1. **If you see Bank balance is moderate but, product price is high.**
      * Increase minimum wage by little bit or decrease it a bit.
      * This causes low inflation or negative inflation and makes country to import products rather than increasing the price.
  
   2. **If bank balance is low and product price moderate, but people poor because of low minimum wage.**
      * Then increase minimum wage more than hint 1.
      * This causes minimum wage to increase however product prices will also increase.
   
   3. **If bank balance is high, product price is high, people are poor.**
      * Then you can increase minimum wage even more (more than hint-2), this causes country to import lot of products instead of increasing product price. 
      * However bank balance will decrease considerably while importing, that is why lot of bank-balance is needed.
